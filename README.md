# calculatorTDD

This project implements a simple calculator in **Java** following the **Test Driven Development (TDD)** approach. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication for both two and multiple integers.

## Features

- **Add Function**: adds two or more integers together.
- **Multiply Function**: Multiplies two or more integers.
- **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: The project is developed using TDD, ensuring tests are written before implementing functionality.
- **JUnit 5**: Unit testing framework for Java, used to verify the correctness of the calculator functions.

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains the main Java source code.
    - `Calculator.java`: The main calculator class that performs the arithmetic operations.

- **src/test/java**: Contains unit tests for the calculator.
    - `CalculatorTest.java`: Test class where the functionality of the `Calculator` is tested using JUnit 5.

## Development Process
This project follows the Test Driven Development (TDD) process:

- **Write tests**: First, the expected behavior is defined by writing unit tests using JUnit 5.
- **Run tests**: The tests are run and expected to fail initially.
- **Write code**: The code is written to satisfy the failing tests.
- **Refactor**: The code is refactored to improve structure without altering its behavior, and the tests are re-run to ensure correctness.
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
